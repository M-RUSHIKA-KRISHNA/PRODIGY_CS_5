Network Packet Analyzer in Python
This project demonstrates a simple network packet analyzer using Python within a Jupyter Notebook. The analyzer captures and analyzes network packets, providing insights into source and destination IP addresses, protocols, and ports. Built with the scapy library, this tool is valuable for understanding network traffic and behaviors. Note that this project is for educational purposes only, and capturing network traffic should only be done with proper authorization.
